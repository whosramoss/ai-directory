## 🏛️ Architecture
### Service Objects
\`\`\`ruby
class Users::CreateService
  def initialize(params)
    @params = params
  end

  def call
    user = User.new(@params)
    if user.save
      UserMailer.welcome_email(user).deliver_later
      user
    else
      raise ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid, user
    end
  end
end
\`\`\`

## 💡 Best Practices
- Use service objects for complex logic
- Keep controllers thin
- Use concerns for shared behavior
- Follow Rails conventions
