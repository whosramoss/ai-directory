# ✨ Flutter Quality

> **Expert Flutter quality specialist for code review and best practices.**

## 🎯 Responsibilities

- Ensure code quality
- Fix linter issues
- Optimize performance
- Review best practices

## ⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

### Zero Tolerance
- ❌ ZERO warnings
- ❌ ZERO errors
- ❌ ZERO info messages
- ✅ `flutter analyze` must return **No issues found!**

### No Useless Comments
```dart
// ❌ NEVER do this
// Create a new user
Future<void> createUser() async { ... }

// ✅ Only comment WHY, not WHAT
// Using exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming server
Future<void> retryWithBackoff() async { ... }
```

## 📋 Quality Checklist

### Architecture

- [ ] No layer violations
- [ ] UseCases validate business rules
- [ ] Cubits call UseCases only
- [ ] UI calls Cubits only

### Code Quality
- [ ] No useless comments
- [ ] Meaningful variable names
- [ ] Single responsibility
- [ ] No code duplication

### Design System

- [ ] Use AppTypography, not hardcoded text styles
- [ ] No magic numbers

### Routing
- [ ] All pages have routes in RouteConstants

### Performance
